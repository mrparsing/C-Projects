# 🧠 C Projects — Learn by Building

This repository contains a collection of **small C projects** designed to help you **practice, experiment, and understand** core programming concepts in C.

Each project has a specific purpose (graphics, algorithms, memory handling, etc.) and is categorized by **difficulty level (⭐ 1 – 5)** taken from the internal pagella.

---

## 📚 Goals

- Improve your understanding of the C language.  
- Train your algorithmic thinking and manual memory-management skills.  
- Explore concepts like 2D graphics, physics simulation, data structures, and more.  
- Prepare for exams, coding challenges, or just learn for fun.

### ⭐☆☆☆☆ (1 / 5)

- **[Caesar Chipher](./project/caesar%20chiper/)** — Implementation of the classical Caesar shift cipher.
- **[Vigenère Cipher](./project/vigenere/)** — A straightforward command‑line tool that encrypts a message with a **Vigenère‑like cipher**.
- **[File Obfuscator](./project/file_obfuscator/)** — A C utility that applies a **bitwise NOT** or a **byte-wise XOR** to the contents of a file and writes the transformed bytes to an output file.  
- **[Happy Number Checker](./project/happy_numbers/)** — A tiny command‑line utility that determines whether a given integer is a **happy number**.
- **[Sieve of Eratosthenes](./project/sieve_of_eratosthenes/)** — A simple Sieve of Eratosthenes.
- **[Pascal's Triangle](./project/pascal_triangle/)** — A C program that requests an integer `row ≥ 1` from the user and prints **Pascal’s Triangle** up to that row.
- **[Credit Card Validator](./project/credit_card_validator/)** — A command‑line utility that checks whether a numeric string passes the **Luhn checksum**.

---

### ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (2 / 5)

- **[Number‑to‑Words Converter](./project/number_names/)** — A program that converts an integer in the range **0 – 9999** into its English words representation.
- **[libcurl GET Client](./project/curl/)** — A minimal example program that performs an HTTP **GET** request using **libcurl**.  
- **[Mandelbrot Set](./project/mandelbrot_set/)** — Render the Mandelbrot set to an SDL window.  
- **[Pong game](./project/pong_game/)** — A simple two-player Pong clone in C using **SDL2** and **SDL\_ttf**, with a basic victory screen.  

---

### ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3 / 5)

- **[Ball gravity simulation](./project/ball_gravity_simulation/)** — An **interactive particle sandbox**: balls fall, collide with each other (elastic-ish with restitution), bounce on walls/floor, and resolve penetration against obstacles.  
- **[Game of life](./project/game_of_life/)** — Implementation of **Conway’s Game of Life**.  
- **[Linux Keylogger](./project/linux_keylogger/)** — A minimal C program that reads **raw key-press events** from the Linux *evdev* interface.  
- **[Neural Network from scratch](./project/neural_network/)** — A minimal multi-layer perceptron that learns the XOR function using **stochastic gradient descent**, **binary cross-entropy**, and **sigmoid activations**.  
- **[Raytracer 2D (SDL2)](./project/raytracing/)** — A simple 2D raytracer that visualizes light interacting with a circle.  
- **[Rotating Cube](./project/cube/)** — A program that renders a rotating 3-D wireframe cube using **SDL2**.  
- **[ASCII Rotating Cube](./project/terminal_cube/)** — Another 3D cube rotating but in the terminal.  
- **[Two-Body Orbit Simulation](./project/orbiting_planets/)** — A program that simulates a two-body gravitational interaction. A small blue planet orbits a larger yellow body, with a trail showing its past positions.  
- **[Ray-casting demo](./project/raytracing/)** — A small app that casts ~200 rays against a circle and shows intersections.  

---

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4 / 5)

- **[Three-Body Problem (SDL2)](./project/3_body_problem/)** — A leap-frog integrator simulating the famous three-body figure-8 orbit and drawing trails.  
- **[MD5 Implementation](./project/md5/)** — Implementation of the MD5 algorithm.  
- **[RSA Encryption and Decryption with GMP](./project/rsa/)** — RSA implementation using C and the GMP library for handling big numbers.  
- **[Sudoku Generator & Solver](./project/sudoku/)** — Generates a **fully‑valid Sudoku** and solves it with backtracking.


---

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 / 5)

- **[AES-128](./project/aes/)** — A **minimal implementation** of core AES-128 encryption & decryption steps in C.
- **[Liquid simulation](./project/liquid%20simulation/)** — A program that simulates water flowing through a grid of square cells using a very simple cellular model.
