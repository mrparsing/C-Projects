# üß† C Projects ‚Äî Learn by Building

This repository contains a collection of **small C projects** designed to help you **practice, experiment, and understand** core programming concepts in C.

Each project has a specific purpose (graphics, algorithms, memory handling, etc.) and is categorized by **difficulty level**.

---

## üìö Goals

- Improve your understanding of the C language.
- Train your algorithmic thinking and manual memory management skills.
- Explore concepts like 2D graphics, physics simulation, data structures, and more.
- Prepare for exams, coding challenges, or just learn for fun.

### ‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ Easy

- **[RSA Encryption and Decryption with GMP](./rsa/)** ‚Äî RSA implementation using C and the GMP library for handling big numbers.
- **[RC4 Stream Cipher](./rc4/)** ‚Äî Implementation of the RC4 encryption algorithm.
- **[MD5 Implementation](./md5/)** ‚Äî Implementation of the MD5 algorithm.
- **[Linux Keylogger](./linux_keylogger/)** ‚Äî A minimal C program that reads **raw key press events** from the Linux *evdev* interface.
- **[File Obfuscator](./file_obfuscator/)** ‚Äî A C utility that applies a **bitwise NOT** or a **byte-wise XOR** to the contents of a file and writes the transformed bytes to an output file.
- **[Caesar chipher](./caesar%20chiper/)** ‚Äî Implementation of the classical Caesar shift cipher.
- **[libcurl GET Client](./curl/)** ‚Äî A minimal example program that performs an HTTP **GET** request using **libcurl**.

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ Medium

- **[Raytracer 2D (SDL2)](./raytracing/)** ‚Äî A simple 2D raytracer that visualizes light interacting with a circle.
- **[Pong game](./pong_game/)** ‚Äî A simple two‚Äìplayer Pong clone in C using **SDL2** and **SDL\_ttf**, with a basic victory screen. 
- **[AES-128](./aes/)** ‚Äî A **minimal implementation** of core AES-128 encryption & decryption steps in C.
---

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Advanced

- **[Ball gravity simulation](./ball_gravity_simulation/)** ‚Äî An **interactive particle sandbox**: balls fall, collide with each other (elastic-ish with restitution), bounce on walls/floor, and resolve penetration against obstacles.
