# 🧠 C Projects — Learn by Building

This repository contains a collection of **small C projects** designed to help you **practice, experiment, and understand** core programming concepts in C.

Each project has a specific purpose (graphics, algorithms, memory handling, etc.) and is categorized by **difficulty level**.

---

## 📚 Goals

- Improve your understanding of the C language.
- Train your algorithmic thinking and manual memory management skills.
- Explore concepts like 2D graphics, physics simulation, data structures, and more.
- Prepare for exams, coding challenges, or just learn for fun.
